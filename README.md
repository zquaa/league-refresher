# league-refresher
This app searches for LeagueClientUxRender.exe and kills it. It results in a client reset without leaving from champ selects, lobbies and without interrupting anything else.

### Installation
1. Open up CMD or powershell and type:
```bash
pip install psutil
```
2. Download main.py

### Usage
When in league just open the game and it should hopefully restart your client. 

### Uses these external libraries:
* psutil - to find and kill the task.
